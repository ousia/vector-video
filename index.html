        <p>Online presentations give us the ability to share their wisdom without having to be present when they take place.</p>

<p>With most of the presentations, either you get too much or you don’t get enough.</p>

<p>You don’t get enough when sound is missing. Without audio, without the recorded voice telling the story, you don’t have a real presentation.</p>

<p>You get too much when you get a huge file with the recorded presentation. Besides the file size, presenters aren’t professional actors and most of the footage is simply unnecessary.</p>

<p>Even with a reasonably sized file, image quality may be poor. This can’t be magic. The better image quality, the higher file size it requires.</p>

<p>How would you get simply enough or the best solution? With vector–video presentations. First, we need to answer two questions.</p>

<p>What are presentations? Not simply the slides, but mainly a recorded voice with synced slides. Slides are only a visual aid to the story being told.</p>

<p>What is video? Moving images with synced sound.</p>

<p>Then, the relevant question is: how can we mix both presentations and video?</p>

<p>The standard approach is to record both sound an slides as if it were a movie. So, you get huge file sizes and fixed image quality.</p>

<p>A new approach would be vector video. Slides aren’t moving images. We may benefit from this. Images require a rate of about 25 frames per second in order to display movement. Each single slide may take its whole duration in vector video.</p>

<p>In addition to this, vector images are scalable or may be infinitely increased in size without any quality loss or increment in file size.</p>

<p>Sound in a presentation isn’t music, but recorded voice. This allows much higher compression rates, which result in much smaller output files. And relative quality decreases don’t affect the overall result. Or not as much as it would happen with music.</p>

<p>Video—both in movies and in presentations—comes from syncing sound with the images. The sync in a presentation must come from the duration of each individual slide.</p>

<p>The final result—such as this presentation—may be contained a file format that supports both vector text and images, as well as sound. SWF output is already implemented. The more universal PDF output is on its way.</p>

<p>With vector video, you get much smaller output files and virtually perfect image quality.</p>
